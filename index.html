 <h2> About Us</h2>
    <p>The members of the Society of Pilar popularly known as Pilar Fathers landed first in the North in Sirsa, way back in the 1960s. After a meticulous study of the education scene and as a response to the pressing need of an English medium School, we decided to open the School in 1974 throwing its doors open to the citizens of Sirsa town and other surrounding villages. It is a Minority institution, established under Art. 30 (#1) of the Constitution of India

It was accorded recognition by the Haryana Government and was affiliated to ICSE Board, Delhi. In 2006 the students heaved a sigh of relief when it was upgraded to Senior Secondary. Many well wishers of the School expressed their desire to adopt the programme of studies in accordance with the syllabus laid down by the Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi. Thus, in 2008 the School got itself affiliated to CBSE after seeking the necessary permission from the Haryana Government. The School has over 2800 students studying from L.K.G. to XII.

The School sponsors Xavieran Bal Niketan (poor Boy's Home). The underprivileged boys irrespective of caste, colour are sheltered in the Niketan situated in the complex. Besides meeting their three basic needs, the School looks after their medical and educational expenses.

The Pilar Fathers laid the foundation of the School on firm grounds on the truth that God is the loving Father of us all, which gives mankind the unity of being His loving children, thus ruling out all man-made barriers. This forthright stand, positions, St. Xavier's School, although a Christian School, as a special School which in spite of their belief, is open and willing to admit, accommodate and ready to appreciate diverse hues and tones of the marvel that is "India."
